# WEB-115-Final-Project
JavaScript Final project for WEB-115 Section 4101 Spring 2023 semester at Wake Tech

# Details
This is my (William Henderson) final project for WEB-115 at Wake Tech. The project is designed to be a simple resume creator. The project did not initially involve GitHub, but I thought that it was a good, albeit basic, demonstration of my webapp development skills.
